This Chrome Extension is built to interact with web pages and provide useful information through a popup interface. It uses a background script that runs continuously in the browser to listen for events and manage processes. A content script is injected into web pages to read or interact with their content whenever needed.

The extension features a popup window that opens when the user clicks on the extension icon. This popup displays information dynamically and provides a clean user interface styled with a custom CSS file. It also includes a set of icons that represent the extension visually in the Chrome toolbar and extension settings.

All functionality and permissions are defined in a manifest.json file, which serves as the main configuration for the extension. It specifies the background scripts, content scripts, popup files, icons, and the permissions required to run correctly.

In summary, this Chrome Extension uses standard components — background script, content script, popup page, and manifest file — to offer a simple but functional tool within the browser. It is designed to perform actions related to the user's active browsing session without requiring complex setup.
